## My Projects from Semester 1:

### Calculator (2025)

This calculator is a tool used for math operations quickly. It helps with basic functions like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, and can also change numbers to a percentage, show square roots, and help with exponents. People rely on calculators for solving equations and checking homework, while professionals use them in fields like engineering, finance, and science to ease data analysis and decision making. It is aimed to ease peoples work.

## Jack Quinn and Sam Harmon Group Project - (Burning Rubber Car Game)

Burning Rubber is our simple yet difficult car game, where you must dodge cones as obstacles and pickup gas cans to keep fuel in your car. A meter displayed in the top left corner displays a guage indicating your fuel remaining. If you hit an obstacle or run out of fuel, you will 'crash' and be forced to restart. Try and get the highest score! 

Jack's Highest Score : 4,155 | Sam's highest Score : 3,336

## Bouncing Ball Project - (BallBounce)

This was a guided project we completed in class to teach us programs that include 'mouse pressed' features. In this instance, when you right-click with your mouse, a ball appears on screen.
